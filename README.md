# instagram-bot-to-like-follow-comment-and-unfollow-users-who-havent-followed-you-back-within-a-week
Put your configurations(username & pass) inside the ```config.py``` file.<br>
There are sevral bots here;
1. ```Instapy.py``` follows users based on a given list of #hashtags
2. ```Watch-stories-by-users.py``` watches the public stories/private stories that you have access to of provided user's list.
3. ```Watch-stories-by-tags.py``` watches the public stories available on provided tags list.

## Notice
For this to work, you need to have InstaPy installed https://pypi.org/project/instapy/0.1.0/ <br>
Also, Notice that the original InstaPy package will run into so many errors as Instagram is constantly changing it's codebase.
To fix most of these common errors, I recomend downloading this https://github.com/ErwinKoekoek/InstaPy/tree/master/instapy and replacing what you have locally on the InstaPy folder with it. <br>
Other errors expected to be encountered with are to do with ```Gecko Driver``` Just do a quick google search on how to fix them depending with your machine.<br>

To give a quick headstart incase you're stuck, clone this repo and follow the installation guides it provides on the ```installations``` folder (depending with your OS) https://github.com/InstaPy/instapy-quickstart
